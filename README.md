# NSX Power Operations - An NSX-T Operationalisation Project

![logo](logo.png)

### Overview
NSX Power Operations is a platform that provides NSX users a way to document and healthcheck their VMware NSX-T environment.  Through a series of python scripts, you have the ability to output healthchecks to the terminal or output documentation option in Microsoft Excel format that are easily consumable and referable. The documentation not only captures the Desired State (configuration) but also the Realized State (for example: routing & forwarding tables) across the distributed environment. 

### Releases & Major Branches
Current version: Supports NSX-T 3.x API (December 2020)

NSX-T PowerOps does not perform any ESXi Commands to retrieve data.

NSX-T PowerOps authenticates to NSX-T Manager only

NSX-T PowerOps Master branch is for PowerOps-CLI (see below for PowerOps-UI)

### NSX-T PowerOps-UI
For the UI Version of NSX-T PowerOps, please go to: https://github.com/vmware/nsx-powerops/tree/NSX-T-PowerOps-UI

### PowerOps OVA Install
1. The easiest method to build and run NSX-T PowerOps is to download the nsxt-powerops ova:

       https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VMFGne92ygtY6vhYXACy5_pXti1EuW3N/view?usp=sharing
       
2. Once deployed, login to the powerops VM and ensure you are in /home/powerops

       Default Username / Password:  powerops/powerops

3. Git clone the NSX-T-PowerOps TZ Patch repo:
       
       git clone https://github.com/stephen-sauer/nsxt-pops-tz-patch.git

4. Modify the config.yml with all the relevant information (NSX IP or FQDN, cert path, output folder for XLS files)

      Please see 'Optional Pre-Requisite' below for details on Principal Identity certificate authentication

5. Source 'run_powerops' from /home/powerops/nsx-powerops (source ./run_powerops)


#### Required Pre-Requisites for manual installation:

If you prefer a manual installation, you will need to prepare an environment (for example an 'NSX-T PowerOps' Virtual Machine) with the following:

1. Python 3.x (3.8 preference)
2. Python Module 'xlwt'
3. VMware NSX-T Python SDK
4. Git
5. Access to NSX Manager API with Read Privileges
6. Correct Directory Structure

Example installation using Ubuntu 20.04:

1. Create Ubuntu PowerOps Virtual Machine:
    * Set IP address, Hostname, DNS, etc...
    * Ubuntu 20.04 comes wityh Python 3.8.6 pre-installed
2. Install 'xlwt':
    * pip3 install xlwt
3. Download and install the NSX-T SDK for Python:
    * Download the VMware NSX-T Data Center Automation SDK 3.0.0 for Python from https://code.vmware.com/web/sdk/3.0/nsx-t-python
        * Download all files and copy to VM
    * Install the SDK .whl files using pip3
        * Example: 'python3.8 -m pip install vapi_runtime-2.14.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl' 
4. Install Git
    * sudo apt-get install git
5. Create a 'powerops' user (by default scripts refer to 'powerops' user)
6. Create the following directories under /home/powerops:
    * cert (/home/powerops/cert)
    * powerops_documentation (/home/powerops/powerops_documentation)

#### Optional Pre-Requisite:
If you wish to use PowerOps with a Pricipal Identity Certificate Based user, please create your Principal Identity user in NSX-T and have access to the certificate and key files. Files must be in .crt and .key extension.

1. Copy the certificate and key files into a folder
2. Modify the config.yml (/home/powerops/nsx-powerops/config.yml) file with the folder containing cert and key file 
   (you must do this AFTER cloning the nsx-powerops repo)

### Build & Run
To run NSX-T PowerOps:

1. From /home/powerops git clone the repo (following will clone the master branch of NSX-T PowerOps):
    * `git clone https://github.com/vmware/nsx-powerops.git`

2. Modify the config.yml with all the relevant information (NSX IP or FQDN, cert path, output folder for XLS files)
    
3. Source 'run_powerops' from /home/powerops/nsx-powerops (source ./run_powerops)
